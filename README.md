# Candidate Search

## Description
This application was made for hiring managers. It will call the GitHub API to show GitHub users with a description that includes name, location, bio, and other information. The user can click a ✅ button which will allow them to add a GitHub user to a potential candidates page. If the user does not want to consider the candidate, they can click the ❌ button and view the next candidate. This is repeated until there are no candidates to display. Then, they can go to the Potential Candidates page to see a table of the candidates they saved.
